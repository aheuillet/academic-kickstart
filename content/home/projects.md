## **Explainability in Reinforcement Learning**

I participated in the redaction of a survey on state-of-the-art explainability methods for reinforcement learning.
We also implemented a novel technique for explaining collaborative tasks in multiagent environments.
Check out our code [here](https://github.com/Fabien-Couthouis/XAI-in-RL)!

## **ARNN**

As part of a school project, I created a Web app (using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)) for [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/en) researchers that helped them train their RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) and visualize results in an intuitive way. Check out the code [here](https://github.com/aheuillet/ARNN)!

## **Othello Player**

I implemented an [AlphaZero](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.01815.pdf)-like [Othello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi) player as a school project. It is based on a [Monte-Carlo Tree Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search) algorithm improved by a neural network powered move prediction.
